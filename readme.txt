WordPress Multipurpose Theme - Secretum is a highly customizable fluid-responsive multipurpose WordPress theme.


== Description ==

Secretum is a highly customizable fluid-responsive multipurpose WordPress theme for both beginner and advanced WordPress users. Customize over 350 individual customizer settings (with more under-development) all without adding CSS to the <head> of your website. This means all pages across your entire Website to have a smaller filesize, sometimes 50-75% smaller, allowing your Website pages to load faster, across more devices and Internet connection types. All Customizer settings are built using or extending the default WordPress customizer features, without 3rd party plugins or fancy scripts that slow your building experience down. Secretum was created to save you time and money checkout the feature list below to see how!
